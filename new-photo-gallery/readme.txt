The core functionality centers on a grid-based display that keeps your images organized. When a visitor clicks on an item, it opens in a lightbox, providing a focused view of the image or video. This feature is particularly useful for portfolios, product showcases, or event albums where visual detail is important.

Beyond standard images, the plugin supports video content from YouTube and Vimeo, allowing you to create mixed media galleries. You can also utilize the layout options to present team members or partner logos in a structured format. The interface is designed to be intuitive, letting you upload media and generate shortcodes without complex configuration.
